Option 1:
 Deploying Frontend via Nginx on Your Server (Web Server)
In this method, you will build your React app into static files and then serve them using Nginx, which is a high-performance web server.

Step 1: Build Your React App
Navigate to the frontend directory:
cd /home/bizgaze/vsm/frontend

Install dependencies (if you haven't already):
npm install


Build the app for production: This will create a build folder containing the optimized, static files:
npm run build

Step 2: Install and Configure Nginx
Install Nginx: If you don’t have Nginx installed, run the following commands:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx

Configure Nginx to serve the React build files:

Create a new configuration file for your app in /etc/nginx/sites-available/:
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/vsm-frontend


Add the following configuration:
nginx

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_server_ip;  # Use your server's IP address or domain name

    location / {
        root /home/bizgaze/vsm/frontend/build;  # Path to your built React app
        try_files $uri /index.html;  # React Router handling
        index index.html;
    }
}

Enable the site by creating a symbolic link:
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/vsm-frontend /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

Test and restart Nginx to apply the configuration:
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx

Step 3: Access the App
Now, you should be able to access your frontend app at the IP address of your server:

arduino
http://your_server_ip
If you want to use HTTPS, I highly recommend using Certbot (Let's Encrypt) to get a free SSL certificate.

Step 4: Secure with SSL (Optional)
Install Certbot (for SSL):
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx

Run Certbot to obtain an SSL certificate for your domain:
sudo certbot --nginx -d your_domain.com
Follow the prompts to configure SSL and automatically redirect HTTP to HTTPS.


Option 2:
 Deploying Frontend on Platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or Docker
These platforms provide seamless deployment with built-in Continuous Integration (CI), HTTPS, and CDN support. Let’s look at how you can deploy your frontend on Vercel, Netlify, and using Docker.

A. Deploying to Vercel

Vercel is one of the easiest platforms to deploy React apps.

Sign up or log in to Vercel: Vercel

Install Vercel CLI: If you prefer using the CLI, you can install it:
npm install -g vercel

Link your project to Vercel:
In your frontend directory, run:

vercel
Vercel will prompt you to link your project to a Vercel account and automatically build and deploy your React app.

Automatic deployment:

Vercel will automatically detect your React project, install dependencies, build the project, and deploy it. It will give you a URL for accessing your app.

Custom Domain:

You can easily add a custom domain to your Vercel project through the Vercel dashboard.


B. Deploying to Netlify
Netlify is also one of the easiest platforms to deploy frontend applications and provides automatic builds from Git.

Sign up or log in to Netlify: Netlify

Push your code to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket: If your code isn't already on a version control platform, you should push it to GitHub (or another Git provider).

Link GitHub repo to Netlify:

In your Netlify dashboard, click New site from Git.

Select GitHub and authorize Netlify to access your repositories.

Select your project repository, and Netlify will automatically configure the build settings.


Configure build settings:

The default build command for React is:
npm run build
The publish directory should be the build folder:
/build

Deploy your site:

After configuring the build settings, Netlify will automatically deploy your site. You’ll get a URL where your app will be hosted.

Add a custom domain (optional):

You can add a custom domain through the Netlify dashboard, and it will handle HTTPS for you.


C. Deploying Using Docker
If you want to deploy your app in a Docker container, you can follow these steps:

Create a Dockerfile in the frontend directory: Here’s a basic Dockerfile for deploying a React app:

dockerfile

# Step 1: Build the app
FROM node:16 as build

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
RUN npm run build

# Step 2: Serve the app with Nginx
FROM nginx:alpine

COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80

CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
Build your Docker image:

In your frontend directory (where the Dockerfile is located), run:
docker build -t my-react-app .
Run the Docker container:

Once the image is built, you can run the container:
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name my-react-app-container my-react-app

Access the app:

Your React app should now be running at http://your_server_ip:80.

Comparison of Options
Nginx Deployment:

Pros: Complete control over your server and deployment process. Good for production setups where you manage everything.

Cons: Requires more manual setup and maintenance, including server security.

Vercel / Netlify Deployment:

Pros: Easiest to deploy with automatic builds, Continuous Integration, SSL certificates, and CDN. Free for most small projects.

Cons: Less control over the infrastructure, but this is often fine for frontend apps.

Docker Deployment:

Pros: Great for containerization, easier to replicate environments, and deploy to various platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, etc.).

Cons: Requires Docker knowledge and managing a containerized environment.

Conclusion
If you're looking for ease of use and quick deployment, Vercel or Netlify are great choices. They simplify the deployment process and handle things like SSL, custom domains, and CDN for you.

If you prefer more control or are deploying in an existing server environment, deploying with Nginx or Docker would give you more flexibility.
